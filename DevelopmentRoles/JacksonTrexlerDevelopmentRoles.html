<p> 
A job role that interests me is Network Administrator. A Network Administrator is someone who is practiced in information technology, or IT for short, and manages the network for an organization. Managing such
networks requires the overseeing of security, hardware/software installations, checking licenses, general upkeep, and backups. Network Administrators are very important for all of the needs they fufill, and are often of high status within the company.
